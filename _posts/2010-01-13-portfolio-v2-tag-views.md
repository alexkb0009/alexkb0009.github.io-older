Goal of this project was to present better ways of navigating site's vast supply of content based on users' interest.

To start, it was decided to create 'by-tag' views in a more condensed, browsable, and filterable format. David Desandro's Masonry library was utilized to enable a grid layout with visible transitions when sorting. Planned near the end of a long to-do list is to integrate the interactive view better with Drupal by allowing AJAX requests to fetch & refresh content (in JSON format), perhaps through Backbone.js or similar. This design was adapted then to a newer version of the portfolio, with a similar intent of condensing content to be more browsable.
