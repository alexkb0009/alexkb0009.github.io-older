An in-progress project for connecting those looking to buy beautiful homes to real estate agents.

Horizontally scalable with OpenShift PaaS, using MongoDB and Redis as persistent and temporary data stores, respectively with Redis also used as a PubSub queue to synchronize servers' states.

As lead designer & developer until leaving near the end of 2016, built out the initial versions of the back-end API (Flask), web front-end (Jinja2, React.js), and iOS mobile application (React Native).
