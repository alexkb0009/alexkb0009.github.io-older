ICS hosted the North American component of the Qt Developer Days conference in 2013, 2013, and 2014, as well as the Qt World Summit in 2015. For each of these conferences I designed and developed signficant components of the site as part of a team. These components included an interactive and responsive schedule as well as a secure voting & scoring mechanism which allows participants to indicate which presentations they might be most interested in. For marketing the 2012 Qt DevDays, I was also tasked with developing designs for printed merchandise and promotions such as a postcard and swag bags.
