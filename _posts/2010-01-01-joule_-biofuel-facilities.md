I became interested in the work that Joule Unlimited - a Massachusetts-based company utilizing algae and water to convert CO2 into bio-fuel - was performing after a research project on alternative energy. I offered and executed a contract with Joule to create visualizations / renderings of planned facilities. With a tight budget, after some exploration I settled on using a combination of free CAD/3D software which consisted of BRL-CAD for initial to-specification modeling, Blender for scene layout and renderings, and Gimp for post-production. Project requirements had two components - a close up and distant views of facilities.
