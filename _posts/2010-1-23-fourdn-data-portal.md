Leading front-end development of the 4D Nucleome (4DN) project's data coordination portal.

Utilizing React.js to build out a single-page application (SPA) website which enables researchers to upload, share, browse, and download large data-files relating to the research of 4DN.

Back-end is built in Python 3 as a RESTful API using the Pyramid web framework, with server-side rendering of the API response performed with React.js.

Notable and unique visualization features include Workflow and File Provenance graphing component(s) which can graph any CWL-based Workflow representation, which will at some point be published as a standalone React component or library through NPM/GH.
