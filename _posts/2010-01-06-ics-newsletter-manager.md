This was a proof-of-concept script & interface coded in 15-20 hours in Python without any third-party dependencies (e.g. Django, Bottle, SQLAlchemy, etc.) to provide a way of managing newsletters for ICS's marketing department using SQLite. This tool was developed as a response to the issues encountered using Drupal to create a similar system. This tool lacks some functions which might be required for production, e.g. re-using 're-usable' blocks and deleting existing newsletters.
