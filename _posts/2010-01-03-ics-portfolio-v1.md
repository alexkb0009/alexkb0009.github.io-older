An interactive HTML5 & JS portfolio which was originally created as a standalone web app within a CakePHP website and later integrated into Drupal 7. Features of the portfolio include tagging (using Drupal's taxonomy terms) and filtering (via JS + CSS). Project was created out of a need to showcase some of ICS's UX design and engineering work. Slides, their content and order is managed from a configuration page within the site's employee section.
