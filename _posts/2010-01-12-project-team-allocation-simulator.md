This is an experimental simulation of a combinatorial auction created in about two weeks for a course where-in multiple employees may auto-bid via a scoring mechanism using data such as their skills and interests (e.g. input through user profiles) compared against project requirements to obtain a bid valuation. Project requesters (you, in this simulation) may then create requirements in the form of project keywords and roles (+ skills & rating) required to calculate best team for the project based on set of employees' supposed preference to the project topic and each other via maximization of factors leading to favorable group dynamics (e.g. shared communication preferences and interests, geographic proximity).
