In development; leading front-end team. A platform for clinicians to submit patient cases for DNA sequencing. Will be able to run analytic pipelines on sequenced DNA data in order to attempt to identify genetic and yet-undiagnosed diseases.

Source code is initially based on that of the 4DN Nucleome Data Portal; common reusable components have been split out and will be re-used while the overrall look & feel will diverge.
