Development of the ICS User Experience 'parallax' marketing page (in finalization as of February 2014).

Performed complete implementation of the design & mockups, which was produced by ICS's UX Design Team, as well as providing feedback, feasibility of implementation, and iterating on the design. Finally (not pictured), integrated with existing ICS website's CMS (Drupal) for synchronization of top-level menu.

Implemented using JavaScript + HTML/CSS, with some PHP for integration with Drupal.
