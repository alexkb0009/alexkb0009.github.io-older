`react-workflow-viz` (suggestions for better name are welcome) is a distributable module library containing a React components and parsing functions that can be used to visualize workflows, pipelines, and similar graph structures. The entry `GraphParser` Component accepts via a prop a [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/)-like JSON structure that has been extended by adding target references to future steps for bidirectionality.

It was originally created in the [4DN Portal]({% post_url 2010-01-23-fourdn-data-portal %}) to visualize CWL workflows as well as provenance of processed files which were generated by [analytic pipelines ran in AWS](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/tibanna).

Will be published on NPM sometime in the near future.
